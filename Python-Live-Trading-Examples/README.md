# Python Strategy Template
This repo contains several single file, fully functioning trading algorithms using FXCM’s Python wrapper (fxcmpy). These close-of-bar strategies are all based on the “Python Strategy Template.py” file that is fully explained inside this Quant News article: https://www.quantnews.com/algo-trading-in-python-developing-a-live-strategy-template

More strategies will be added over time to provide traders easy-to-understand Python examples of common trading techniques. Please email api@fxcm.com if you have questions or suggestions!
